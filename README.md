# at_notes

## Overview
This is a note editing and sharing application that will allow users 
to be able to create notes and share it with others in a surveillance-free, 
and easy-to-use environment within the @platform. Users will login to their 
@sign account to manage their notes. All notes are encrypted to a secondary 
server, so users donâ€™t need to worry about their data being collected without 
their notice.
